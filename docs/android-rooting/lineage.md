# Lineage-based ROMs

This guide will help you bypass root detection on Lineage based roms.

## BShield

> Thanks [im-yuuki](https://github.com/im-yuuki) for telling me this method!

Use [BShield-Lineage](https://git.disroot.org/cuynu/bshield-lineage/releases) (thanks goat `cuynu`) module to bypass. Note that you still have to bypass universal root detection by other methods and not just by relying on this module.

## Others

Use other roms that isn't Lineage based (e.g. PixelOS as they base from AOSP directly)
