# Root Hiding

So, you want to use Magisk but without being detected by banking apps? Then this guide is for you :D. Note that for better hiding results, consider using KernelSU/APatch/KernelSU-Next/SukiSU which implemented root hiding in mind.

## Magisk

Magisk doesn't support root hiding or any of the hiding steps, so to get Magisk with those, use [Magisk Alpha](t.me/magiskalpha)
