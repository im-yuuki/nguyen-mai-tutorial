# Play Integrity (Strong)

This will cover the most basic way to get Play Integrity with STRONG verdict.

> Note that it might break Google Wallet, so consider that in mind. Both me (LOS) and my friend (Pixel user) got broken Google Wallet when using this method.

## Required modules

Install these 

+ [PIF Fork](https://github.com/osm0sis/PlayIntegrityFork/releases/latest)
+ [Tricky Store](https://github.com/5ec1cff/TrickyStore/releases/latest) (or use forks)
+ A keybox provider

or

+ Integrity Wizard (you'll need to find this module manually)

#### Keybox provider
