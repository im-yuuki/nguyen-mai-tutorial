# Play Integrity (Strong)

This will cover the most basic way to get Play Integrity with STRONG verdict.

> Note that it might break Google Wallet, so consider that in mind. Both me (LOS) and my friend (Pixel user) got broken Google Wallet when using this method.

Install these 

+ [PIF Fork](https://github.com/osm0sis/PlayIntegrityFork/releases/latest)
+ [Tricky Store](https://github.com/5ec1cff/TrickyStore/releases/latest) (or use forks, but IDK)
+ [Tricky Addon](https://github.com/KOWX712/Tricky-Addon-Update-Target-List/releases/latest)
> Optionally, not tested but maybe.
> + TSupport Advance

or

+ Integrity Wizard (you'll need to find this module manually)

Then install these

+ [BetterKnownInstalled](https://github.com/Pixel-Props/BetterKnownInstalled)
+ [Sensitive-Props](https://www.pling.com/p/2129780)


After that do the following:

+ Open the manager
+ Tap "Play" button on PIF Fork and wait
+ Tap "Play" button on Tricky Store
+ In Tricky Addon screen: ||| -> Select All -> Deselect Unnecessary -> Set Valid Keybox -> Set Security Patch -> Get Security Patch Date -> Save (in the Security Patch screen) -> Save
+ Reboot and hope it works
