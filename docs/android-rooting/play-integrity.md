# Play Integrity (Strong)

This will cover the most basic way to get Play Integrity with STRONG verdict.

> Note that it might break Google Wallet, so consider that in mind. Both me (LOS) and my friend (Pixel user) got broken Google Wallet when using this method.

## Required modules

Install these 

+ [PIF Fork](https://github.com/osm0sis/PlayIntegrityFork/releases/latest) / [PIF Next](https://github.com/EricInacio01/PlayIntegrityFix-NEXT) (for WebUI)
+ [Tricky Store OSS](https://github.com/beakthoven/TrickyStoreOSS/releases/latest) / [Tricky Store](https://github.com/5ec1cff/TrickyStore/releases/latest) (latest proprietary version is on Telegram)
+ A keybox provider

or

+ Integrity Wizard (you'll need to find this module manually)

#### Keybox provider

Install either one of these modules
+ [Tricky Addon](https://github.com/KOWX712/Tricky-Addon-Update-Target-List/releases/latest) (recommended)
+ [TSupport Advance](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/vaqw80238bp5d7xdvn9kg/TSupport-Advance.zip?rlkey=sx3dl2wea0782alndqj9sz8qi&st=b5zuucjn&dl=1)

### Optional modules

These may be needed if you've done all the steps in the guide but still failing Play Integrity check (please check using Play Store, don't use external apps)

Install these

+ [BetterKnownInstalled](https://github.com/Pixel-Props/BetterKnownInstalled)
+ [Sensitive-Props](https://www.pling.com/p/2129780)
  
## Set the keybox

Do the following:

+ Open the manager
+ Tap "Play" button on PIF Fork and wait
+ Then follow the method below for the keybox provider you use.

### Tricky Addon

Do the following:

+ Tap "Play" button on Tricky Store.
+ In Tricky Addon screen: ||| -> Select All -> Deselect Unnecessary -> Set Valid Keybox
+ (Only if you're using proprietary Tricky Store) Set Security Patch -> Get Security Patch Date -> Save (in the Security Patch screen)
+ Save.

### TSupport Advance

And finally for both, reboot and hope it works.
