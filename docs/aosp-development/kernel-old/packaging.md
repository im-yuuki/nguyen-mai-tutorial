# Packaging (AnyKernel3)

This will help you on packaging the kernel for ready to use as a ZIP file.

## Clone the AnyKernel3 repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/osm0sis/AnyKernel3
```

## Edit the kernel information

Now, cd to `AnyKernel3` directory. You should see a script called `anykernel.sh`, open that script and edit the value to reflect the device you're working for.

## Include the kernel

Put the `Image` to the root of `AnyKernel3` directory

## Package the folder

Package everything inside `AnyKernel3` to a ZIP file, and now that ZIP is ready to use!
